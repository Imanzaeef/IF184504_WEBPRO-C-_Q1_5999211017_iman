            <br />
            Penang is a Malaysian state located on the northwest coast of Peninsular Malaysia, by the Malacca Strait. 
            It has two parts: Penang Island, where the capital city, George Town, is located, and Seberang Perai (Mainland) on the Malay Peninsula. 
            They are connected by Malaysia's two longest road bridges, the Penang Bridge and the Sultan Abdul Halim Muadzam Shah Bridge (Penang Bridge 2); 
            the latter is also, as of May 2019, the longest oversea bridge in Southeast Asia. The second smallest Malaysian state by land mass after 
            Perlis on the north, Penang is bordered by Kedah to the north and the east, and Perak to the south.

            <i>Seberang Perai</i>is the second largest city in Malaysia by population.
            Its heterogeneous population is very different in terms of ethnicity, culture, language and religion.
            Apart from the three main races, the Malays, Chinese, and Indians, my hometown is also home to the Eurasian, Siamese and expatriate communities.
            George Town is my captal hometown is also home to a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The people here often name the people of Penang as Penangite.
            The modern history of Penang began in 1786, after the founding of George Town by Francis Light.
            Penang formed part of the Straits Settlements in 1826, which became a British crown colony in 1867.
            Direct British rule was only briefly interrupted during World War II, when the Japanese occupied Penang; The British took back Penang in 1945.
            Penang was later merged with the Federation of Malaya (now Malaysia), which gained independence from the British in 1957.
            Following the decline in its enterprise trade in the 1970s, Penang’s economy was geared towards high-tech manufacturing.
