          <h4><u>SUMMARY</u></h4>
          <p align="Justify" style="line-height: 2.5">
            <br />
            The Malaysian state of Penang comprises of a peninsula and an island which are linked by two of the country's longest bridges. 
            Because of its colonial architecture, connected with the 2nd World War and the various green areas that encompass anything from formal botanical gardens to tropical jungle, George Town, Penang's capital, 
            has become a significant tourist attraction in Malaysia. George Town sections were also declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites, partly due to their marine urban communities known as clan jetties.
            See my list of Penang's best tourist attractions for suggestions on how to spend your time after you reach Malaysia.
